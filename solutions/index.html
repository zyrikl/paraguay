                <h2>Well, how do we fix those issues?</h2>
                <p>The sad thing is, Paraguay's economy is not developed enough, and even if it had a developed economy, its male population is <i>still</i> crippled by the War of the Triple Alliance. However, we can still build this step-by-step. Because Paraguay is literally the head of the gun trafficking network, they can stamp out the suppliers and instead of pouring more money to just catch individuals, spend it on a better judiciary system.</p>

                <p>The issues tab stated: the landlocked country of Paraguay has a unique flag: it is different on both sides. Though Paraguay has a cool flag, it still has country-level issues. Paraguay is considered developed, but one in four people live in poverty. Paraguay also suffers from corruption. Their ruling party, the Colorado Party, has had unbroken power (except for one incident from 2008 to 2013) from 1947 to now. Paraguay should also control gun trafficking and have better punishments in their judiciary system.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Paraguay can fix this by introducing more political parties. It should not cost much, and if the Colorado Party does not like it, it is easy to come to a compromise. Paraguay should at least try to end corruption. Winning elections does not come on huge winning streaks. It comes in smaller, more exciting battles.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To fix Paraguayâ€™s gun trafficking, they can train police to recognize firearms more easily and also to grab on site, preventing further loss of life in places inside of Brasilia and Buenos Aires. Paraguay should grab ahold of these weapons, and even sell them back to different countries to get the parts and use for more money.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In brief, Paraguay should introduce more political competitiveness into its government and end the corrupt rule of the Colorado Party. They have been in power for almost 80 years nonstop, and were even under a dictator until 1989, when the corruption receded.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Finishing up, Paraguay should try to make a more aggressive stance on crime, and use its police to better use. Paraguay should confiscate the weapons and sell them for more money in the government to be spent on a bigger police force.</p>

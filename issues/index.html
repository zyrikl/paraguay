                <h2>What issues are there in Paraguay?</h2>
                <p>Paraguay suffers a lot from increased crimes such as cattle rustling and gun trafficking. Gun trafficking is especially common, as Paraguay is in between two of the largest gun dealers in the South America, Brazil and Argentina.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Paraguay should pour more money into the incarceration and judiciary system to crack down on crime such as gun trafficking across the border to Brazil and Argentina and have fairer punishments.</p>

                <p>The landlocked country of Paraguay has a unique flag: it is different on both sides. Though Paraguay has a cool flag, it still has country-level issues. Paraguay is considered developed, but one in four people live in poverty. Paraguay also suffers from corruption. Their ruling party, the Colorado Party, has had unbroken power (except for one incident from 2008 to 2013) from 1947 to now. Paraguay should also control gun trafficking and have better punishments in their judiciary system.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Continuing on, Paraguay has had huge problems with corruption. The government is controlled by the Colorado Party. This party was founded back in 1887, when Francisco Solano López died and left Brazil, Bolivia, and Argentina to do something with the remains of Paraguay. Paraguay’s party was also apparently the only legal ruling party between 1947 and 1962. During that time, the party set up mini militias on the extremely fascist side.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Paraguay has a huge problem with weapons. A terrorist organization called Hezbollah set up an illegal trafficking unit of weapons there. Because of Paraguay’s proximity to Brazil and Argentina, Paraguay has been “the middleman” to send weapons to gangs in those countries. Hezbollah has also used Paraguay to fund its finances, all of which are, nonetheless, illegal. In 2019, Paraguay marked Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To wrap up, Paraguay has had an extremely corrupt history. Even in the mid-1900s, Paraguay only allowed one party. Even after abolishing that rule, they still had a dictator, Alfredo Stroessner.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Similarly, Paraguay’s gun trafficking has been a huge issue, sending in European firearms into Brazil and Argentina right into the hands of gangs. These all need to stop, and Paraguay should fix it.</p>

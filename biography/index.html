                <h3>Francisco Solano López</h3>
                <p>Francisco Solano López was the 2nd president of Paraguay, after his father. López is regularly remembered as a hero in Paraguay, but some disagree. In fact, López remains the only president of Paraguay to have been killed in action. The question remains, how did this man manage to rise to power?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Before López became the president, he was an ambassador to France, among other government positions. He stayed for a while in Paris, where he met an Irishwoman named Eliza Lynch. He was also a brigadier general in the army, then a divisional general, and he became the President afterwards.</p>
                <br>
                <p>López was born to the president Carlos Antonio López of Paraguay. Carlos used his legal knowledge to secure power after the previous dictator died. However, he soon became corrupted too and became a dictator. Though both son and father were dictators, Francisco, more so. Quickly after his father’s death in September of 1862, he used the army to guarantee his power. Soon, he was getting into trouble left and right. López secured Paraguay a spot in a war, the War of the Triple Alliance. This was fought against Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay from 1864 to 1870. Of course, Paraguay being smaller than the combined forces, López not only lost 40% of Paraguay’s land but also lost 90% of his country’s male population.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Francisco Solano López died of his wounds from a spear pike and a sword hit to the head. Apparently, he either screamed “I die with my nation”, or “I die for my nation” when attacked by the enclosing enemy. Since López had died, this marked the end of the War of the Triple Alliance. Because of Paraguay’s losses, it is also called the Paraguayan War.</p>
